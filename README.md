# Machine Learning in CO2 reduction

## Research Questions
- Determine the relationship between available parameters and target (faradaic efficiency, FE)?.
- Develop accurate predictive model for the FE response.
- Explain the impact of the features on the FE response.
- Design novel conditions with the proposed ML-based models.
